# Vue Grove

ðŸŒ± A growing collection of Vue.js techniques, composables, patterns, UI designs and experiments.

## Overview

Vue Grove is a personal compilation of everything I've learned and implemented in Vue.jsâ€”from reusable composables to advanced state management tricks. Think of it as a **developer's garden** where each component, hook, or utility is a thriving plant in the Vue ecosystem.

## Features

- **Composables Library**: Reusable composition functions for common tasks
- **Component Patterns**: Examples of effective component design and architecture
- **State Management Solutions**: Various approaches beyond Vuex/Pinia
- **Performance Optimizations**: Tips and tricks to make Vue apps faster
- **Experimental Zone**: Cutting-edge Vue ideas and implementations
